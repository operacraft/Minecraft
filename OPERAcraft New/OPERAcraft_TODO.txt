OPERAcraft TODO
===============

Check camera view switching OK
Check fade OK
Can the textures be downloaded locally? OK
Check camera visibility OK
  projector and regular camera don't see each other OK
Regular camera appearance OK
Check regular camera visibility against players OK
Disable camera green/red helmet IGNORED (LIKELY BROKEN)
textures for players online should not be loading from the internet OK
  later consider implications when someone joins who does not have skins file...
Spectators should not be able to click on anything OK
Spectators should not be able to get inventory OK
Spectators should not be able to pick up things OK
Spectators should not be able to chat OK
projector and cameras should not pick up items OK
cameras should have no shadows OK
Teleporting (storing and retrieving values) OK
added separate cloaks folder and texture support OK
cameras and projector cannot interact with environment (attack/pickup/etc.) OK
Check if it all works on Linux OK
Projector should only show @text and port config and nothing else OK
Actors should be the only ones to be able to pick up things OK
Disabled ability to edit keybindings for custom OPERAcraft mod keys OK
Spectators should be able to teleport using the current first available projector location OK
Remove [Rcon: Teleported <> to <>] on projector's chat OK
When a player is teleported, need to check if we are a camera or a projector and issue the same teleport command to those who are following (camera to projector and projector to spectators) -- fixed by properly referencing player through server, rather than by its visibility (via ModelBiped) OK
Spectator names (above heads) should be invisible to everyone while spectators can toggle visibility of other spectators by using a hide GUI key OK
Spectators should see cameras with their skins OK
Spectators should not see cameras or projector when in Cam View mode OK
Experience should not show on projector view with HUD disabled OK
Connections and disconnections should not show on any of the screens (works whenever host disables it with the hud off since it is the one broadcasting those messages) OK
Other messages should be disabled on cameras and actors as well OK
/kill command should be disabled on projector? Not necessary? OK
Ability to catch-up with the current state before this will work OK
Spectator camera when latched onto the projector reflects xfades OK
Better UI for Spectators reflecting their state OK
Subtitles should be visible on the Spectator screen OK
*Subtitles on the projector should be limited to only one post at a time OK
*Spectators do not erase text on empty message OK
*No labels above actors for spectators OK
*Spectators should not see each other when the GUI is hidden or they are latched onto the main camera OK
*tpset should work for other player as well (from server/projector) OK
*When a player leaves and then rejoins they cannot do that in the same session OK
*Mouth animation request for players who are not nearby kills the network stream from pd-l2ork OK
*Upon disconnecting, client list should be reset OK
*tpall is not always working OK
*Clients cannot connect unless they are close to the projector OK

==========================================================

*Mouth animations do not work on clients, only on owners and projector
*tpset is not always working ???

==========================================================

Textures for players online do not load from the internet
  *does integrated server have ability to serve skins?
  *later consider implications when someone joins who does not have skins file...
  *then maybe they should have skins associated with those usernames
   (rather provide skins for a particular production)
